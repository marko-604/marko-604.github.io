                <h3>Emotion Recognition</h3>
                <h4>Completed - To Be Expanded</h4>
                <p>
                    Developed a Python-based tool to analyze and recognize users' emotional states in real time using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Trained a new model on a public dataset from kaggle, to gain the experience of testing, then fine tuning my results.
                    Leveraged OpenCV for facial feature detection and a convolutional neural network to classify emotions into distinct categories such as happiness, sadness, and anger. The program processes video input, providing dynamic feedback on emotional trends and patterns.
                    Designed for applications in user experience analysis.

                <h4>Early Development</h4>
                <p>
                    The Computer Vision Training Assistant is a tool that will be used by novice gym-goers, to help them understand the correct form for exercises.
                    The tool will use a webcam or existing video to track the user's body movements and provide real-time feedback on their form.
                    The tool will also provide a summary of the user's workout, including the number of reps and sets completed, and possibly the amount of weight lifted.

                    Analyzed a dataset of 4 features which include
                    around 10,000 sample images each, and produced
                    an output of 98% accuracy for splitting the set
                    into 70-30 training-testing categories. The project
                    required accurate feature implementation of
                    convolutional layers and pooling. Results are shown
                    accurately using Matplotlib tools.

                <h5>Reason: Unecessary Further Research. Desired Results Obtained.</h5>
                <p>
                    This tool includes the automation of playing mock games of ‘Mines’, to collect data as to whether or not likelyhoods are accurately implemented.
                    The tool uses automated mouse control, and image recognition to determine which event is occurring. Saving it to a file to be analyzed, by an assistant script.
                    Ultimately, the purpose is to determine whether the gambling site has patterns of its own and learn about how such processes are used to manipulate its users.
