                        <p>
                            Developed a Python-based system for real-time emotion recognition, integrating a local LLM for advanced emotion analysis and interpretation.
                            Utilized computer vision and deep learning techniques, training and fine-tuning a ResNet-50 model on a public Kaggle dataset to classify emotions 
                            into seven categories. Leveraged OpenCV for facial detection and preprocessing, enabling dynamic analysis of emotional trends from webcam or video input.
                            Designed for applications in user experience analysis, gameplay behavior tracking, and interactive AI-driven feedback systems.

                            The Computer Vision Training Assistant is a tool that will be used by novice gym-goers, to help them understand the correct form for exercises.
                            The tool will use a webcam or existing video to track the user's body movements and provide real-time feedback on their form.
                            The tool will also provide a summary of the user's workout, including the number of reps and sets completed, and possibly the amount of weight lifted.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                            around 10,000 sample images each, and produced
                            an output of 98% accuracy for splitting the set
                            into 70-30 training-testing categories. The project

                            This tool includes the automation of playing mock games of ‘Mines’, to collect data as to whether or not likelyhoods are accurately implemented.
                            The tool uses automated mouse control, and image recognition to determine which event is occurring. Saving it to a file to be analyzed, by an assistant script.
                            Ultimately, the purpose is to determine whether the gambling site has patterns of its own and learn about how such processes are used to manipulate its users.<br /><br />
